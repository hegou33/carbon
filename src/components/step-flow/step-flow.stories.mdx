  Product Design System component
</a>

Provide a way to represent an end-to-end journey that a user can complete in one go.

This component has a specific start and end point, as well as showing the current step in the journey.

Use a step flow to help a user complete tasks in a specifc order, based on their needs.

## Quick Start

```js
import StepFlow from "carbon-react/lib/components/step-flow";
```

## Examples

A `ref` is **strongly** recommended to be used, to ensure focus is programmatically moved to a a title div when
a user advances through each step. This ensures screen reader users are made aware of all information throughout the user journey. 
An example of how this can be achieved is provided in the **Example implementation** story.

### Default

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.DefaultStory}/>
</Canvas>

### with category

<Canvas>
  <Story name="all elements" story={stories.CategoryStory}/>
</Canvas>

### with showProgressIndicator

You can set the `showProgressIndicator` prop to `true` to render the progress indicator within the component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="showProgressIndicator" story={stories.ShowProgressIndicatorStory}/>
</Canvas>

### with currentStep

The `currentStep` prop can be used to set the current step, this will update the step label and update the progress indicator. Your
current step can be between `1` and `8`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="currentStep" story={stories.CurrentStepStory}/>
</Canvas>

### with totalSteps

The `totalSteps` prop can be used to change the amount of steps, this will update the step label and determine the amount of step indicators rendered. 
You can have between `1` and `8` total steps.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="totalSteps" story={stories.TotalStepsStory}/>
</Canvas>


### with showCloseIcon

You can set the `showCloseIcon` prop to `true` to render a close icon within the component. You can also use the `onDismiss` prop to pass in a function
which is called when a user clicks on the close icon.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="showCloseIcon" story={stories.ShowCloseIconStory}/>
</Canvas>

### Example implemetation

Please see below an example implemetation of how the component can be used with `Button`'s to advance through the user journey. This also fully details the use of a ref
to programmatically move focus to a title div which contains all of the necessary information for screen reader users (`title`, `currentStep`, `totalSteps` and `category` if added),
in the form of a properly formatted, visually hidden string.

Please see below an example of what this look like in the DOM.

```jsx
<span data-element="visually-hidden-title-text">Add client. Transaction Type. Step 1 of 3.</span>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example implementation" story={stories.ExampleImplementation}/>
</Canvas>

To achieve this, a custom ref handle can be forwarded to the `StepFlow` component:

```tsx
const stepFlowHandle = useRef<StepFlowHandle>(null);
return (
  <StepFlow title="Refund details" totalSteps={3} currentStep={1} ref={stepFlowHandle}/>
);
```

which exposes the `focus()` method of `StepFlow`'s root DOM node:

```ts
stepFlowHandle.current?.focus();
```

This will ensure that screen reader users are not only made aware of any changes to information, but can then also navigate down the page from the `StepFlow` component as they see fit.

### Example implemetation with translations

Various translations can be applied to both the step label, screen reader only title and close icon aria-label.

When providing the screen reader only title the `title`, `category`, `currentStep` and `totalSteps`, have all been passed to ensure screen reader users have all of the same information
as users who can see the component. Please see below how this has been achieved with a French translation.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example implementation with translations" story={stories.ExampleImplementationWithTranslations}/>
</Canvas>
